# Secret Knock

This is a demo Android app that Tim Miller and Nate Ridderman created to explore RxJava in a bit more depth.

It allows you to enter a message and then lock it away by entering a secret knock.
To reveal the message, you must re-enter your secret knock.
Build it yourself and try it out!
